Database calls should be added in a separate folder.
In this project, we add them in the 'helpers' folder.

We will add all the routes in the 'routes' folder and not in the index.js file.

Controllers will be stored in the 'controllers' folder.

joi - used for data validation in javascript.
For eg. here we will use it to check the format of data received when the user registers on our app.
Joi returns an object.

. Session based Authentication:-----------------

When a user logs in, a session is created and saved in mongoDB.
For every login we will see if a session is already present in mongoDB or not.

mongodb session and express session are connected.






JWT:- (in this project we will not user jwt)
JSON Web Token
used for generating tokens for authentication purpose.
It has 2 parts:-
the 1st part of token is the data that we want to send
It can be id, username, email.
password is usually not sent in jwt. It is not needed.

The 2nd part is a sign which is unique for every user.

a JWT token has 3 parts separated with 2 dots.
the 1st part is type of jwt token, 2nd part is the payload and 3rd part is the signature.
refer to the IBM notes on JWT.

When the token is sent from the server to the client, it is stored in the local storage and
after that whenever an API call is made, this token is passed from the client to the server via headers for authentication.
